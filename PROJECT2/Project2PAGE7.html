    <p><font color="white"> And into the woods they awoke, the boy hollow and empty, the girl dense and full, but they awoke separate from each other. The boy looked for her in the trees, but the girl was nowhere to be found. Deep into the trunk she sat alone, curled, the spine popping out of her back, the wings torn and stretched out toward the earth. The darkness disrupted her, and she hugged her knees, rocking and muttering to herself, tears fighting her eyes, her gift of words fighting her mind. Eventually, he walked in, blending with the shadows of her fear and crept up to her, frightened, but not of her, of himself. He didn’t want to scare her away. There was an absence in him, that caved the room in an emptiness that made it feel as if she was the only one there. He opened his mouth and asked his friend, “ What’s the matter,” but she didn’t respond, because when he spoke, nothing came out. She stared him straight in the eyes, bewildered, as if she couldn’t understand the question. He watched it in her eyes, he could see his lost words traveling through her mind, echoing deep until they could reach some part of her fragmented and off in the distance. He hugged against her as she sat trembling. It was troubling. The warmth of the cavern caved in around them as they sat trembling. It was troubling. He focused on that warmth, not because it felt good, but because it was the last thing he could feel, his love, that was being unfolded into plain sight.  So he focused on the specifics, in an almost mechanical resort for survival. The dark browns of the tree trunk’s interior, the wood flakes rubbing against his side, the green that devoured them, the eyes of the creatures outside. They sat there for three days. On the third day she grabbed his hand, the only sign she’d shown of discernible life. She was alive, he knew that, her cheeks and lips  glowed of warmth, a trickle of pee beneath her legs, and the fuzz of hair on her arms, but her touch was the only real emergence through the surface, and it tapped him to her presence. She grabbed his hand and said the first complete thought she’d ever said, “ I’m not filled in.” “Not filled in?” The boy repeated to himself, but he couldn’t make the words out loud, and they grappled in his head, to search for her. He would do anything for her, he loved her so much and only wanted her to be real, to be happy. It was troubling.

    <p><font color="white"> They had been gone for a long time, and no one searched for the boy, he had completely disappeared from the paths that were laid out for him. That was how he liked it. But soon the boy began to fade away in the life the girl had so beautifully stolen. She had taken everything he felt. She had taken his heartbeat, taken his words, and now she had taken his soul. They were one, in unison, but in a way neither of them were ever gone. The closer he inched to her, the more he cracked open like a stone, and the more complete she became, crystallizing into a woman of purpose and desire. And so he took form. His wings a collection of sudden events, forgotten moments, his translated lifetime. They made his life discernable. His body, a host of an interrupted story, and he absorbed all of the lost entropy, it buried within the boy. The girl could open her mouth to speak, and she did so at will, and like a butterfly the boy spread his wings away into the heavens so that she could live on Earth forever, with him as her guide. Before anyone noticed they had been gone, where no one could ever find them.
