<p>Objectivism was a new code of morality that helped shape the internet, because it revolves around the vision of a society where old forms of political control would be unnecessary because computer networks would create this. Rand’s idea was transferred to the internet, allowing each individual to carry out their freedoms and desires while naturally creating order, which formed the basis of the dynamic that we see today. Her lifestyle vision was commodified with the use of computers and devices, allowing this parallel world of the Internet to form, where people had freedom but collective order.  This plays into the Californian ideology that computers would liberate us from political control, but in the end, this didn’t occur as we are still bound by the larger global system that has lots of control over what we do. I find this whole idea fascinating, because I have similar opinions as Ayn Rand, though I think human connection and relationships are necessary, I have always believed that one should do what they want first and foremost. I think humans should always look out for themselves first and will be more successful doing so, I don’t find it selfish, but I think it’s part of the reason an individual is alive so they can carry out their personal motives through following desire.
