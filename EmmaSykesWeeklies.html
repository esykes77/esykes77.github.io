<p>Objectivism was a new code of morality that helped shape the internet, because it revolves around the vision of a society where old forms of political control would be unnecessary because computer networks would create this. Rand’s idea was transferred to the internet, allowing each individual to carry out their freedoms and desires while naturally creating order, which formed the basis of the dynamic that we see today. Her lifestyle vision was commodified with the use of computers and devices, allowing this parallel world of the Internet to form, where people had freedom but collective order.  This plays into the Californian ideology that computers would liberate us from political control, but in the end, this didn’t occur as we are still bound by the larger global system that has lots of control over what we do. I find this whole idea fascinating, because I have similar opinions as Ayn Rand, though I think human connection and relationships are necessary, I have always believed that one should do what they want first and foremost. I think humans should always look out for themselves first and will be more successful doing so, I don’t find it selfish, but I think it’s part of the reason an individual is alive so they can carry out their personal motives through following desire.

<p>Poor Images sacrifice good quality and resolution for the ability to upload, download, reformat, share, and reedit, and it worsens as it accelerates. In short they are heavily compressed but travel quickly. In terms of value, Hito Steyerl says that “Poor images are poor because they are not assigned any value within the class society of images—their status as illicit or degraded grants them exemption from its criteria” and that  they are “the debris of audiovisual production, the trash that washes up on the digital economies’ shores” as many important and applauded works have been resurrected as poor images. Poor images allow you to keep the files for long periods of time. Thus, poor images have become a large apart of capitalism and the economy, as they aren’t there for the quality or originality, but because they exist, circulate, and are temporary. They are about “defiance and appropriation just as it is about conformism and exploitation.""

<h2>Weekly 4</h2>
<p> I do think humans can be understood through cybernetics. It’s hard to deny that every aspect of our visual and abstract world revolve around systems of some sort, from  ecosystems, to social systems, to brain connectivity. I think this is a big part of why we are alive, a feedback loop and cumulative affect of how our lives play off of each other and with the earth. It definitely plays a large role with people psychologically and physically, as well as other organisms and extending into the technological world.
